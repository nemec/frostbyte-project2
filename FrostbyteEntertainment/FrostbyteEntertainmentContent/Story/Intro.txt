Long ago, a group of four men attempted to trick the gods into giving each of them power over one of the elements. The men believed that with control over earth, lightning, water, and fire, they could control the world.

The gods, however, saw the evil in the hearts of these men, and devised a plan of their own.

The men - Solum, Percutio, Madesco, and Exuro - were given the powers they sought, but were condemned to an eternity in a domain dominated by their respective elements. Legends tell of these men and their slow descent into madness and corruption at the hands of the gods, who vowed to never show the men a hint of mercy.

Now, centuries later, a reclusive student of alchemy and the elements has succeeded where the original organization could not. Through his extensive studies, this man - Caelestis - has found a way to harness the power of earth, lightning, water, and fire without the consent of the gods, and the gods sense evil intentions in his heart. 

You have been chosen to seek out and destroy Caelestis before he can succeed in carrying out the evil plans the gods have sensed.  If you are to have any hope of surviving, the gods have stated that you must also have control over the elements. In order to accomplish this, Solum, Percutio, Madesco, and Exuro must be sought out in turn and destroyed, for the only way a mortal can gain the power of an element is to end the life of the current holder of the god-granted power.
