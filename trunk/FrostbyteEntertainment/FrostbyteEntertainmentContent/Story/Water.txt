Day 1

How was I dragged into this stupid plan! 

I can't believe I let Percutio convince me to attempt this trickery. Now I'm stuck for eternity in this massive maze of a temple will only the numerous fountains to keep me company. 

What good is this power over water when its only use is as a toy to pass the time? I need to search this place, to find food lest I starve...drinking water can only keep me alive for so long.

Day 6

It's been five days since last I wrote, and still I have found no food. I wonder if starvation is possible here? I definitely feel hungry, but death would be too simple of a way out of this godforsaken place. 

Besides, what will happen after I die? Will I become a ghost to wander this temple forever? Or will the gods be even more angry with me and condemn me to an even worse fate than this.

Day 18

I've finally found life! Owls swoop high in the rafters overhead and I hear the howling of wolves as I sleep. I've drowned the animals in conjured water and am finally rid of my hunger.

Day 33

Strange things have begun to happen. It's getting more difficult for me to breathe. It seems like my nose is clogging and I feel, no...these can't be gills opening on my neck. 

And yet, I feel so comfortable in the water, almost as if I'd rather live my life here than on dry land...
