Gods...who are they to decide which of us are special and which deserve to live our lives alone and powerless? 

They've taken so many loved ones from me, leaving me here in this castle to die a weak and lonely man. This is no way for one to live. If I were a god, I would never allow this to happen to anyone.

What makes a god? All powerful and omniscient, gods can do anything. They have ultimate control and power over all things...who's to say I can't become a god?

I have begun to spend my days with my nose buried in books. Books of alchemy and black magic. 

Power over the elements...power over the elements will bring me power over this earth. Every rock, stream, flame, and spark will be mine to control. With this strength, all peoples will kneel before me as their god, or face death by the elements.

This is true power. 

This is how I will become a god.

Solum, Percutio, Madesco, and Exuro. Four fools who attempted to deal directly with the gods to gain power over the elements. The gods did what they do best, confining these men to a life of despair and solitude, just as they did to me. I'll use this to my advantage. No god or man will know of my work until the day comes that I take this world, and become god of all people.

I've done it! 

The earth shakes at a wave of my hand, lightning cracks the sky with a snap of my fingers, water and ice flow freely from my palms, and fire consumes all at my will. The gods will be stunned to see that I have created the elements alone; gained powers they have held secret for centuries in a matter of years! 

The world is mine. All who oppose me will suffer, and I will seek revenge against the gods for the sufferings they have caused me.

I'm growing stronger. How did I ever live without this power?! The elements are a part of me now. Even this castle is bending to my will; my halls have become forests, caverns, and magma-filled pits. Soon, the world will be my domain.
