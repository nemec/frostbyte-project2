I've made a mistake. This place is so empty, so open. There's no end to the exploration, and the only food I can find are bats and spiders. It is impossible to tell night from day and one day from the next. My home is the cold, hard ground, and I see no way out. There are peculiar beasts of rock and crystal wandering the cave who also feast on the organic life in this cave. The interesting part: they don't seem to mind me, so long as I stay out of their way.

I was wrong about the beasts. The deeper into the cave I traversed, the more hostile they have become. It seems that every time I kill a bat or spider, I get eerie stares from the monsters. Maybe I'm imagining things, but it seems like they are plotting against me...

I was right. Two days ago (or at least, it seems like two days ago), while I was eating a particularly delectable bat, I felt a horrible strength lift me by my head. I cannot remember anything after that; the immensity of the force of contact must have caused me to black out. All I know is that I am now imprisoned in this horrible, tiny room. And the beasts grumble about taking their revenge on my invasion... something about a ritual in the Inner Crystal Sanctum.
