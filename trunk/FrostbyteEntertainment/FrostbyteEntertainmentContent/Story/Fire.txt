Day 2

Fire! Fire and lava everywhere I turn, gods this heat is unbearable! 

How am I to live an eternity here? I touch the flames but my skin does not burn, I dive into the lava only to return to shore unscathed, yet I feel the constant heat of this place; there is no escaping it. 

But I have to find a way out, surely there is a place where I can find solace from this hellish nightmare.

Day 12

I've wandered endlessly throughout this place and cannot find peace. There is no hope. All I can do is wander endlessly through this place and hope that the gods will have mercy on me. 

I'm sorry for what I've done. The power over fire was not worth all this...I just want my old life back. Gods, please, have mercy on me.

Day 68

They will not come. I will never escape this place. My only hope is that eventually my body will be overcome by the heat and I will no longer have to suffer in this place. I have power over this element; I must try to consume my body in the fire. It is the only way out.
