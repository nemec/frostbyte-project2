Day 5

This place isn't so bad. I've always loved the outdoors, and it's so green here! The gods have blessed me. While Exuro burns in torturous flames and Madesco drowns in a never-ending sea of water, I stroll through these peaceful woods, hunting game and harvesting an abundant crop of berries and fruit.

This is heaven.

Day 13

I was bitten by a strange creature today. A small worm with hundreds of tiny teeth. It crawled from an apple I picked earlier today just as I was about to bite into it. Even though I was bitten hours ago, the dotted circle it left on my hand still aches and pulses with every beat of my heart. What I wouldn't do for some of grandma's medicine about now...

Day 28

This can't be happening. I'm beginning to see things that no man should have to see. The trees have come alive, they follow me and whisper as I sleep. There are wasps the size of swine that swarm the fruits and game that support me, leaving behind only green trees that bear no fruit, as if to tease me as I starve.

My wound from the worm has worsened. It might be the starvation talking... but I swear my teeth are sharpening. I cut my tongue on one of them in my sleep last night, and when I awoke, I had a slimy, sticky film over my entire body.

What's happening to me?
